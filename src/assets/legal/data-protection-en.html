We only store access data in so-called server log files. In addition to the browser type, operating system, referrer URL, pages visited, date and time of access, this also includes your IP address. </p><p>This may in principle be personal data because, under certain conditions, it is possible to use it to find out the identity of the owner of the Internet access used by providing information from the respective Internet provider.  </p><p><strong>Processing purpose</strong> </p><p>The server log file data is processed by us exclusively for the purpose of secure and trouble-free operation of the website. </p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong> </p><p>The IP address is processed on the basis of our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art.

Wix&#x27;s privacy policy can be viewed at <a href="https://de.wix.com/about/privacy" target="_blank">https://de.wix.com/about/privacy.</a> </p><p><strong>Storage duration</strong> </p><p>The log file data is deleted after seven days . </p><p> </p><p><strong>II </strong>	<strong>Processing to answer your inquiries</strong> </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing</strong> </p><p>We process the personal data that you voluntarily provide to us when contacting us, in particular by email, when using our contact form or when making an inquiry by telephone. We also process your IP address when you submit the contact form. </p><p><strong>Processing purpose</strong> </p><p>This data will only be processed for this correspondence with you and for the purpose for which you have provided us with the data in the context of this communication, e.g. to process your request or to contact you at your request. </p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong> </p><p>The processing takes place on the basis of your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time with effect for the future.  </p><p>Insofar as the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you or to carry out pre-contractual measures at your request, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR. </p><p>The legal basis for processing your IP address is our legitimate interest in enabling communication between our server and your end device. </p><p><strong>Storage duration</strong> </p><p>After your request has been fully processed, your data will be blocked for further use and deleted after any existing retention periods have expired, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we otherwise have a right to store it. </p><p> </p><p><strong>III.</strong>	<strong>Processing of applicant data</strong> </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing</strong> </p><p>On our website, we offer you the opportunity to apply for a job with us. In doing so, we process the data that you provide to us during the application process. </p><p>If you do not provide us with this data (in particular name, contact details, information on professional qualifications), we will not be able to process your application.  </p><p><strong>Processing purpose</strong> </p><p>Your data will only be used for the purpose of deciding whether to establish an employment relationship with you and will only be forwarded internally to the responsible contact persons who will decide whether to fill the position you have applied for. If you do not apply for a specific vacancy (unsolicited application), we will use your data for all vacancies that match your requirements at the time of application. </p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong> </p><p>We are authorized to process this data in accordance with Art. 88 GDPR in conjunction with Section 26 (1) sentence 1 BDSG (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – Federal Data Protection Act). </p><p><strong>Storage duration</strong> </p><p>If your application is rejected, we will delete your data after the application process has been completed and a retention period of 6 months has expired. Your data will only be stored beyond this period if you have given your express consent. In this case, your data will be deleted by us after 2 years at the latest, unless you request us to delete it beforehand. </p><p> </p><p><strong>IV.</strong>	<strong>Newsletter</strong> </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing</strong> </p><p>We offer a newsletter on our website in which we provide regular information about our products and services.   </p><p>As a subscriber, in addition to the actual newsletter, you may also be informed about circumstances relevant to the newsletter service (e.g. changes to the newsletter offer or technical reasons). Such information will also be sent to the email address you have provided.  </p><p>If you request to receive the email newsletter we offer on our website, we will process your email address and any data you voluntarily provide to us when registering for the newsletter.  </p><p>If you do not provide us with your email address , we will not be able to send you our newsletter. </p><p>We use the &quot;double opt-in&quot; procedure to check that a registration has actually been made by the owner of the registered email address. For this purpose, you will receive a confirmation email from us after submitting your email address, in which you must confirm your registration for the newsletter by clicking on a link. Only after this confirmation will your email address be added to the newsletter distribution list. As proof for us, we log the registration for the newsletter, the sending of the confirmation email and the receipt of the requested confirmation. The time of registration and confirmation as well as your IP address are also stored.   </p><p><strong>Processing purpose</strong> </p><p>The purpose of processing your email address is to send you newsletters by email. We process further data in order to be able to address you personally in the newsletter. </p><p>The processing of further data upon registration serves to document and verify your registration. </p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong> </p><p>The legal basis for sending the newsletter is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. </p><p>The legal basis for the logging of the aforementioned data is our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR in being able to prove your consent in case of doubt. This type of processing is common on the Internet and can therefore be expected, so that your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms do not outweigh our legitimate interest. </p><p><strong>Recipient</strong> </p><p>The newsletter is sent via our service provider BREVO. You can view their privacy policy at https://www.brevo.com/en/legal/privacypolicy/ .  </p><p><strong>Storage duration</strong> </p><p>The data will be stored for the duration of the subscription to our newsletter and deleted after unsubscribing from the newsletter unless statutory retention periods require longer storage. Data that is also stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this.  </p><p>If you unsubscribe from our newsletter mailing list, we may store your email address in a so-called blacklist if this is necessary to prevent future mailings.  </p><p>The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your and our legitimate interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending newsletters and not sending unsolicited newsletters. The legal basis therefore arises from Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.  </p><p>Storage in the blacklist is not limited in time.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>V.</strong>	<strong>Appointments</strong> </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing</strong> </p><p>We provide you with a tool on our website that you can use to book consultation appointments with us.

You can view their privacy policy at <a href="https://meetergo.com/datenschutz/" target="_blank">https://meetergo.com/datenschutz/.</a> </p><p>An alternative booking form is provided by Microsoft.

Cookies are data records that are stored on your end device by the Internet browser. A cookie contains, for example, a string of characters that enables your browser to be uniquely identified when you return to the website. Cookies cannot execute programs or transfer viruses to your computer. </p><p>Cookies can be stored on your end device either temporarily for the duration of a session (&quot;session cookies&quot;) or permanently (&quot;permanent cookies&quot;).  </p><p>Session cookies are automatically deleted immediately after the end of your visit to our website. Permanent cookies, on the other hand, remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or they are automatically deleted by your internet browser.  </p><p>Cookies may also originate directly from us (&quot;first-party cookies&quot;) or from third-party companies (&quot;third-party cookies&quot;). Third-party cookies enable, for example, the integration of certain services from third-party companies within websites. </p><p>Cookies have various functions. For example, they may be technically necessary to ensure certain functionalities of a website (e.g. the shopping cart function). Other cookies are not required in this way and are used, for example, to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes. </p><p>As a rule, you can set your browser in a way that you are informed about the setting of cookies, the setting of cookies is excluded for certain cases or in general, or you only allow the setting of cookies in individual cases. You can also delete stored cookies in your browser settings.  </p><p>Without cookies, however, the functionality of our website may be limited. </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing, purpose of processing and storage period </strong> </p><p>We use the following cookies on our website: </p><figure style="max-width:1044pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6548c6e5ab9a929dbb64e897/66014560d4f34ae35a9a1513_Datenschutz.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div></figure><p> </p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong> </p><p>Cookies that are technically required to carry out the electronic communication process and to provide certain functions (e.g. for language settings) are used on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In this respect, you and we have a concurrent interest in the provision of a secure and fully functional website. </p><p>All other cookies that are not technically necessary are set exclusively on the basis of your consent, § 25 para. 1 TTDSG and - insofar as personal data is processed - Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. </p><p> </p><p><strong>VII. </strong>	<strong>YouTube</strong> </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing</strong> </p><p>We may also embed videos from the YouTube website on our website.  </p><p>The operator is Google Ireland Limited (&quot;Google&quot;), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.  </p><p>If we embed YouTube videos (alternatively, the embedded videos can also be stored directly on our server), we use YouTube exclusively in the &quot;Extended data protection mode&quot; . According to YouTube, this mode means that YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. However, the transfer of data to YouTube partners is not necessarily excluded by the &quot;Extended data protection mode&quot;. This means that YouTube can establish a connection to the Google DoubleClick network regardless of whether you watch a video.  </p><p>As soon as you start a YouTube video on this website, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. This tells the YouTube server which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account, you also enable YouTube to assign your surfing behavior directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account beforehand.  </p><p>Furthermore, YouTube may store various cookies on your end device after starting a video or use comparable recognition technologies (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way, YouTube can obtain information about you. This information is used, among other things, to record video statistics, improve user-friendliness and prevent fraud attempts. If necessary, further data processing operations may be triggered after the start of a YouTube video, over which we have no influence.  </p><p>You can find more information about data protection at YouTube in their privacy policy at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de</a>.     </p><p><strong>Processing purpose</strong> </p><p>The purpose of the processing is to be able to show you the corresponding YouTube videos. </p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong> </p><p>YouTube videos are used exclusively on the basis of your consent, which you give when you click on the &quot;play button&quot; of a video, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future.  </p><p><strong>Recipient</strong> </p><p>The recipient of the data is Google Ireland Limited. </p><p>If personal data is also transferred to the USA, the company is certified in accordance with the &quot;EU-US Data Privacy Framework&quot;.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>VIII.</strong>	<strong>Google Maps</strong> </p><p>We also use the Google Maps service. This allows us to show you interactive maps directly on the website and enables you to use the map function conveniently.  </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing</strong> </p><p>When you visit the website, Google receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding subpage of our website. In addition, the above-mentioned basic data such as IP address and time stamp are transmitted. This occurs regardless of whether Google provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be assigned directly to your account. </p><p>If you do not wish to be associated with your Google profile, you must log out before activating it. Google stores your data as usage profiles and uses them for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or the needs-based design of its website. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide needs-based advertising.  </p><p>The information collected is stored on Google servers, including in the USA. Google LLC is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.  </p><p>Further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider can be found at <a href="http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy" target="_blank">www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy</a>.    </p><p><strong>Processing purpose</strong> </p><p>The purpose of processing is to be able to show you maps with locations or routes. </p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong> </p><p>The use of Google Maps is based exclusively on your consent, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You can revoke this at any time with effect for the future. </p><p> </p><p><strong>IX.</strong>	<strong>Google Analytics</strong> </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing</strong> </p><p>We use Google Analytics on our website, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited (&quot;Google&quot;), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. </p><p>In addition to cookies, Google Analytics can also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). These web beacons can be used to analyze information such as visitor traffic on websites. The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the use of our website (including your IP address) is transmitted to a Google server, possibly in the USA or other third countries, and stored there.  </p><p>Google provides detailed information on the processed data at <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/#infocollect" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/#infocollect</a> and at <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/" target="_blank">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/.</a> </p><p>We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization (&quot;anonymize IP&quot;) activated. This means that your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or within the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. </p><p>Furthermore, we have concluded a data processing agreement with Google for the use of Google Analytics. Google processes the data on our behalf in order to evaluate the use of our website or to compile reports on website activity for us.  </p><p>You can prevent Google from processing your data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>.  </p><p>Further information can be found in Google&#x27;s privacy policy: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de</a>.   </p><p><strong>Processing purpose</strong> </p><p>By integrating Google Analytics, we pursue the purpose of analyzing user behavior on our website and being able to react to it. This enables us to continuously improve our offering and tailor it to the interests of users.  </p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong> </p><p>The legal basis for the processing is exclusively your consent (§ 25 TTDSG [Telekommunikation- Telemedien- Datenschutzgesetz – Federal Telecommunications-Telemedia Data Protection Act] or Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR). You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. You can also deactivate the settings for personalized advertising at <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=de" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=de.</a> </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>X.</strong>	<strong>HubSpot</strong></p><p>We use HubSpot, a service provided by HubSpot Inc., USA, on our website. HubSpot uses so-called “web beacons” and cookies that are stored on your device and allow us to analyze your use of the website. HubSpot evaluates the collected information (e.g., IP address, geographical location, browser type, duration of visit, and pages viewed) on our behalf to generate reports about website usage and user behavior. This helps us continuously improve our website and enhance the user experience.</p><p>Processing is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR, provided you have given this via our cookie banner. The data is generally transmitted to and stored on a server operated by HubSpot in the USA. HubSpot is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, ensuring an adequate level of data protection.</p><p>For more information on data processing by HubSpot, please refer to HubSpot’s privacy policy:<br/><a href="https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy</a></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>XI.</strong>	<strong>Social media (plugins)</strong> </p><p><strong>Type and scope of processing</strong> </p><p>We may use social media plugins on our website. </p><p>We will only regularly link to our social media channels. Occasionally, however, we may also embed posts in social media channels in our website or enable the sharing of posts. The embedding takes place via the service provider Flockler <a href="https://flockler.com/de" target="_blank">(https://flockler.com/de</a>), whose privacy policy can be viewed at <a href="https://flockler.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://flockler.com/privacy-policy</a>.

This integration ensures that no connection is established with the servers of the respective providers when a page of our website containing such plugins is accessed. Your browser only establishes a direct connection to the servers of the activated providers when you activate the plugins and thus give your consent to data transmission. The content of the respective plugin is then transmitted directly to your browser by the corresponding provider and integrated into the page. By integrating the plugins, the providers receive the information that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a profile with the corresponding provider or are not currently logged in to the service of the respective provider. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted directly from your browser to a server of the respective provider, possibly in a non-EU country, and stored there. </p><p>If you are logged in to one of the providers&#x27; services, the providers can directly associate your visit to our website with your profile/account with the respective provider. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking the &quot;Like&quot; button, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a server of the provider and stored there. The information is also published on the social network or on your social media account and displayed to your contacts there. If you do not want the providers to assign the data collected via our website directly to your profile/account in the respective service, you must log out of the respective service before activating the plugins. </p><p>The legal basis for this type of processing is therefore your consent within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future.  </p><p><strong>Receiver</strong> </p><p>Recipients may be the respective service providers of the social network.  </p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p> </p><p><strong>XII. </strong>	<strong>Other tools</strong> </p><p>In addition to the aforementioned tools, we use  </p><p>(i) FoxBase, a service of FoxBase GmbH. </p><p>Among other things, FoxBase provides information on which areas of our website are particularly clicked on.
